# Finch Robot Project â€“ Dance Project

##  Project Description

This project uses a Finch 2.0 robot programmed in Java to complete the dancine routine challenge. The robot uses movement and sensors to create an interactive behavior.

---

##  Objectives

* Apply Java to real world creativity
* Implement robot behavior using Finch
* Practice problem-solving and debugging

---

##  Design Choices

 We chose the dance routine because: it was simple, innovative, and fun.
* Used these concepts:

  *  Arrays / ArrayLists
  *  Static methods or constants
  *  User input


##  Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1**: Robot drifted when turning or moving fast

**Solution**: We reduced the motor speed slightly to make the movements more stable and consistent. Slowing down the turns helped keep the robot in place during the routine.

**Challenge 2**: Timing the robot's movements to sync with the music

**Solution**: We had to experiment with different durations and adjust motor speeds to match the beat. After some trial and error, we matched the movement rhythm with the tones.

##  Future Enhancements

* Add more user input controls
* Improve sensor accuracy
* Add more advanced choreography
* Save data to a file or add maze learning
