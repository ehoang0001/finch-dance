## Forking, Commiting, Pushing to GitHub
1. After making any changes local project code base, on GitHub desktop you will see those "commits" (updates). You will need to "fork" the repo, which will make a difference reference than the original (think "Save and make copy" in Google Doc). Click the "Create a Fork" link in the bottom left corner of GitHub desktop
![fork](/assets/images/fork.png)

2. When the menu opens up, click "Fork this Repository"
![fork2](/assets/images/fork2.png)

3. In the next menu, click "For my own purposes" and then click "Continue". This will make your own repo on GitHub that is not the same branch as the propject template.

4. In the bottom left of GitHub desktop, you can now "stage commits" to your own repo/ Put the message "init commit" to stage the initial commit. 
![commit](/assets/images/commit.png)

5. In the main screen on GitHub desktop, you will now see option to "Push commits to the origin remote." Click that button and your repo will be now on your GitHub with the changes!

**NOTE**: You will need to continue to "commit" new changes every day in class, and "push" the changes to your GitHub at the end of class. This is software development!

## Demo Java File

Check out the `src/main/java/com/example/FinchDemo.java` file for an example of how to use the Finch robot.

## Running Java Files

1. In VS Code, press <code>ctrl + `</code> to open your terminal in VS Code
2. Type `ls` to see the files in your current directory. If you dont see your project's `.java` file you will need to navigate to the directory with the `.java` file you are executing
3. he comand `cd` will change your current directory, aka move to a different folder. You just need to provide the path to the directory.
    - Typically you will just need to type: `cd src/main/java/com/example`
4. Type `java` then the name of your java file to run
    - Ex: `java FinchDemo.java`
